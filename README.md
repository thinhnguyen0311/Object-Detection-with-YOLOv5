# Object Detection with YOLOv5
Object Detection is a task in computer vision that focuses on detecting objects in images/videos.

There are various object detection algorithms out there like YOLO (You Only Look Once,) Single Shot Detector (SSD), Faster R-CNN, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), etc.

In this project, YOLOv5 is used to train a model to detect people in images.
